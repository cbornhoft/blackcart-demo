# Blackcart Demo Documentation

Welcome to yet another RESTful JSON API! I was going to run with SOAP, but then
remembered it's no longer 2003.

## Features

This demo comes with a few features to make stores secure and easy to manage:

* User Registration Endpoint
* Token Provisioning
* Basic Token Authentication
* Store Management
